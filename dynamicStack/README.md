# DYNAMIC STACK  

Works the same way and follow the same rules as the previous **stack**, but is dynamic. Being dynamic means that we don't have to set a max size before creating the stack itself, like that the stack can grow without limit, and it uses a different part of the memory for that, the **HEAP**.  

## PROS and CONS  

- Same as the stack.
