I'm using this repo right now to write everything I know about **Linear Abstract Data Types**, hope it can help you too. First of all, what's an abstract data type?  

Basically, with abstraction as the prime concept behind it, an Abstract data type is nothing more than a data type that is not part of the built-ins(*Float, int, double, etc.*), so that means it is created by the user. With that, comes the operations that can be realized with them, that are also implemented by them, however, **how** it is implemented doesn't matter much for the final user, as long as it works, that happens because of another important concept in ADTs, **Encapsulation**.  
For an ADT to work properly, its implementations must always follow some rules, it is better explained inside this repo's folders.
