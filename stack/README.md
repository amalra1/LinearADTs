# STACK  

It is easier to visualize a stack if we think of it as an array, but vertical. Stack's main rules follow the **LIFO** (*Last In First Out*) or **FILO**(*First In Last Out*) principle, imagine it as a literal stack of plates, you can only put one on top of the other, and can only take of the one that is on top.  
  
## PROS  
- Simple to implement;
- *Push* and *Pop* are really fast, O(1) worst case scenario.

## CONS
- Limited access (Can only manipulate the top);
- Fixed size.

It's like tools, tools can be useless if not used for the right reason.
