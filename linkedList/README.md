# LINKED LIST

The **linked list** is the most complex ADT of the ones implemented so far, that's because we can do any adding/removal/any operations anywhere in it. This happens because of two pointers, **head** and **tail**. So basically, we can make a queue using a linked list, and we can also make a stack using a linked list, aside from being dynamic in the memory.  

## PROS and CONS  

- Same as the queue, when compared to the other ADT done befone, the linked list is the most complex one because of its pointers, so it can be used to any situation, since it can add/remove from the beginning/end/anywhere.
