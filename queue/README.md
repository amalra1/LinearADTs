# QUEUE  

A Queue operates very similarly to the dynamic stack but it follows a different set of rules that command the operations, the **FIFO**(*First In First Out*) concept. For it to work, we have to change the pointer that used to look for the *top* in the stack case, now we need one that looks for the beginning of the queue, let's call it **head**, and another that points to the end of the queue, **tail**.

## PROS and CONS  

- Same as the dynamicStack, better used in a FIFO situation.
